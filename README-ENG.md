# **Creation and Addition of Matrices with Random Numbers in Python**

Educational program with **3 fundamental exercises** to learn how to work with **matrices** (lists of lists) in Python using random numbers.

### **What this code does**

#### **Exercise 1 – Random 3×3 Matrix**

* Generates a 3×3 matrix with random numbers from 1 to 10
* Displays the numbers (although there's a small formatting detail)
* At the end, it prints the complete matrix as a list of lists

#### **Exercise 2 – Addition of Two Matrices**

* Asks the user for the size `n` (creates n×n matrices)
* Generates two matrices `A` and `B` with random numbers
* Automatically calculates `C = A + B` (element-wise addition)
* Displays all three matrices

#### **Exercise 3 – Addition and Subtraction of Matrices**

* Same as Exercise 2, but also calculates:

  * `C = A + B` → addition
  * `D = A − B` → subtraction
* Displays all four matrices: A, B, C, and D
